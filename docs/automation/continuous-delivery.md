## Continuous Deployment
Our Continuous Deployment system comprises only **one** workflow file that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/SWP2025/schedule-builder-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-and-build.yml).
Moreover, we used the following testing and static analysis tools in the system:
- `black` (widespread code linter),
- `isort` (inputs sorting),
- `pytest` (universal Python code testing library).

All CD workflow runs can be accessed [here](https://github.com/SWP2025/schedule-builder-backend/actions).
