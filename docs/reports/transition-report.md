### Future product plans
The customer's plans for the product are to transfer the plugin to one-zero-eight, use the plugin, and check whether
anything else has to be patched. The customer will continue working on the project
via one-zero-eight club. The condition of collaboration continuation is integration with one-zero-eight club.

### Strategies for increasing product usefulness

specialist, ask whether the person uses the plugin, and explain how the product works for them to understand that it
is a valuable piece of software if they do not use it.
