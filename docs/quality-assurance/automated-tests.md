## Automated tests
**Q1:** Which tools were used for testing?

We used the following tools:
- `pytest` (because of the tool's widespreadness),
- `pytest_asyncio` (in order to set up testing fixtures).

**Q2:** Which types of tests have been implemented? 

We implemented **unit** and **integration** tests.

**Q3:** Where are the tests of each type stored in the repository?

Unit tests may be found [here](https://github.com/SWP2025/schedule-builder-backend/tree/main/tests/unit), whereas integration tests may be found [here](https://github.com/SWP2025/schedule-builder-backend/tree/main/tests/integration).
